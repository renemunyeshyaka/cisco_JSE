Dear CISCO JSE trainees

I'm writing to inform your that, all assignment from our course Java Script Essentials and any other Java Script course that may follow in the coming days; shall be uploaded using github.com to this repository. Take time to read the read me file to know the current assignment. Now, you need to fork my account and clone the cisco_JSE repository ...to your computer. Inside cisco_JSE on your local computer create a folder in your names (e.g mkdir JeanClaudeKamali)  and in that folder you'll place all your assignments (offline) and when you push, push your folder name to the remote (upload) when you're ready to submit.

The first assignment to be upload here, will be:

    3.0.10 SECTION PRACTICE
    3.2.4 SECTION PRACTICE
    3.2.5 LAB Interaction
